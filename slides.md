## ?

Notes:
* Who's heard of Dark Patterns?
* What do you think of when you hear _Dark Patterns_? Eg:
  * Bad design?
  * Poor colour choices?
  * Evil coders and Matrix-code?

Unintentionally confusing

<br>
Or just poor life choices

Notes:
* What do you think?
* Shouldn't have been ticked in the first place, no double-neg, etc

Notes:
* My head exploded.
* I think I have to leave the box unchecked?
* But _actually_ it's mandatory field! (see the red text)

Notes:
* Coined in 2010
* Aims to be a 'pattern library' for naming-and-shaming deceptive UI


Intentionally

1. Confuse
1. Deceive
1. Exploit

Notes:
* Tonight, we're talking design and UI
* But the same things have existed for years
  * Record / CD clubs (dep on your age)
  * Forms with opt-out
  * Non-technical Business practices in general (eg banks who dodge your calls)
* It's called 'Marketing', but now with the power to tailor to your exact eyes

## (Anti-)Pattern Library

Notes:
* This was *_really_* hard to prepare for; there's just so much out there.
* If you can think of your own examples or experiences, let's chat as we go -
  put your hand up etc.
* Let's take a look at what I've seen recently

Notes:
* Really wanted to rag on these people more, but
* Cleaned up their act a lot
* Why? Human/govt intervention.

### David's cheat sheet

If you feel

* pressure,
* panic,
* confusion, or
* see incorrect behaviour...

_It's likely a Dark Pattern._

Notes:
* If something looks to not work _right_ then your spider sense should be
  tingling.  It could just be the system's borked..
